1. **_codelens_**:  
An interactive environment that allows the user to control the step by step execution of a Python program
1. **_comment_**:  
Information in a program that is meant for other programmers (or anyone reading the source code) and has no effect on the execution of the program.
1. **_compile_**:  
To translate a program written in a high-level language into a low-level language all at once, in preparation for later execution.

1. **_token_**:  
One of the basic elements of the syntactic structure of a program, analogous to a word in a natural language.
1. **_assignment statement_**:  
A statement that assigns a value to a name (variable). To the left of the assignment operator, =, is a name. To the right of the assignment token is an expression which is evaluated by the Python interpreter and then assigned to the name. The difference between the left and right hand sides of the assignment statement is often confusing to new programmers. In the following assignment:
`n = n + 1` n plays a very different role on each side of the `=`. On the right it is a value and makes up part of the expression which will be evaluated by the Python interpreter before assigning it to the name on the left.
1. **_assignment token_**:  
`=` is Python’s assignment token, which should not be confused with the mathematical comparison operator using the same symbol.
1. **_class_**:

1. **_evaluate_**:  
To simplify an expression by performing the operations in order to yield a single value.
1. **_expression_**:  
A combination of operators and operands (variables and values) that represents a single result value. Expressions are evaluated to give that result.
1. **_float_**:  
A Python data type which stores floating-point numbers. Floating-point numbers are stored internally in two parts: a base and an exponent. When printed in the standard format, they look like decimal numbers. Beware of rounding errors when you use floats, and remember that they are only approximate values.
1. **_increment_**:  
Both as a noun and as a verb, increment means to increase by 1.
1. **_initialization (of a variable)_**:  
To initialize a variable is to give it an initial value. Since in Python variables don’t exist until they are assigned values, they are initialized when they are created. In other programming languages this is not the case, and variables can be created without being initialized, in which case they have either default or garbage values.
1. **_int_**:  
A Python data type that holds positive and negative whole numbers.
1. **_integer division_**:  
An operation that divides one integer by another and yields an integer. Integer division yields only the whole number of times that the numerator is divisible by the denominator and discards any remainder.
1. **_keyword_**:  
A reserved word that is used by the compiler to parse program; you cannot use keywords like if, def, and while as variable names.
1. **_modulus operator_**:  
Also called remainder operator or integer remainder operator. Gives the remainder after performing integer division.
1. **_object_**:  
Also known as a data object (or data value). The fundamental things that programs are designed to manipulate (or that programmers ask to do things for them).
1. **_operand_**:  
One of the values on which an operator operates.
1. **_operator_**:  
A special symbol that represents a simple computation like addition, multiplication, or string concatenation.

1. **_rules of precedence_**:  
The set of rules governing the order in which expressions involving multiple operators and operands are evaluated.
1. **_state snapshot_**:  
A graphical representation of a set of variables and the values to which they refer, taken at a particular instant during the program’s execution.

1. **_variable_**:  
A name that refers to a value.
1. **_variable name_**:  
A name given to a variable. Variable names in Python consist of a sequence of letters (a..z, A..Z, and _) and digits (0..9) that begins with a letter. In best programming practice, variable names should be chosen so that they describe their use in the program, making the program self documenting.
1. **_chatterbox function_**:  
A function which interacts with the user (using input or print) when it should not. Silent functions that just convert their input arguments into their output results are usually the most useful ones.
1. **_composition (of functions)_**:  
Calling one function from within the body of another, or using the return value of one function as an argument to the call of another.
1. **_dead code_**:  
Part of a program that can never be executed, often because it appears after a return statement.

A function that yields a return value instead of None.
1. **_incremental development_**:  
A program development plan intended to simplify debugging by adding and testing only a small amount of code at a time.
1. **_None_**:  
A special Python value. One use in Python is that it is returned by functions that do not execute a return statement with a return argument.
1. **_return value_**:  
The value provided as the result of a function call.
1. **_scaffolding_**:

An escape character, \, followed by one or more printable characters used to designate a nonprintable character.
1. **_generalize_**:  
To replace something unnecessarily specific (like a constant value) with something appropriately general (like a variable or parameter). Generalization makes code more versatile, more likely to be reused, and sometimes even easier to write.
1. **_infinite loop_**:  
A loop in which the terminating condition is never satisfied.
1. **_indefinite iteration_**:  
A loop where we just need to keep going until some condition is met. A while statement is used for this case.
