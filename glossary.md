12	.	high-level language:	
		A programming language like Python that is designed to be easy for humans to read and write.	
13	.	interpret:	
		To execute a program in a high-level language by translating it one line at a time.	
14	.	low-level language:	
		A programming language that is designed to be easy for a computer to execute; also called machine language or assembly language.	
15	.	natural language	:
		Any one of the languages that people speak that evolved naturally.	
16	.	object code	:
		The output of the compiler after it translates the program.	
17	.	parse	:
		To examine a program and analyze the syntactic structure.	
18	.	portability	:
		A property of a program that can run on more than one kind of computer.	
19	.	print function	:
		A function used in a program or script that causes the Python interpreter to display a value on its output device.	
20	.	problem solving	:
		The process of formulating a problem, finding a solution, and expressing the solution.	
21	.	program	:
		A sequence of instructions that specifies to a computer actions and computations to be performed.	
22	.	programming language	:
		A formal notation for representing solutions.	
23	.	Python shell	:
		An interactive user interface to the Python interpreter. The user of a Python shell types commands at the prompt (>>>), and presses the return key to send these commands immediately to the interpreter for processing.	
24	.	runtime error	:
		An error that does not occur until the program has started to execute but that prevents the program from continuing.	
25	.	semantic error	:
		An error in a program that makes it do something other than what the programmer intended.	
26	.	semantics	:
		The meaning of a program.	
27	.	shell mode	:
		A style of using Python where we type expressions at the command prompt, and the results are shown immediately. Contrast with source code, and see the entry under Python shell.	
28	.	source code	:
		A program, stored in a file, in a high-level language before being compiled or interpreted.	
29	.	syntax	:
		The structure of a program.	
30	.	syntax error	:
		An error in a program that makes it impossible to parse — and therefore impossible to interpret.	
31	.	token	:
		One of the basic elements of the syntactic structure of a program, analogous to a word in a natural language.	
32	.	assignment statement	:
		A statement that assigns a value to a name (variable). To the left of the assignment operator, =, is a name. To the right of the assignment token is an expression which is evaluated by the Python interpreter and then assigned to the name. The difference between the left and right hand sides of the assignment statement is often confusing to new programmers. In the following assignment:	
33	.	n = n + 1	:
		n plays a very different role on each side of the =. On the right it is a value and makes up part of the expression which will be evaluated by the Python interpreter before assigning it to the name on the left.	
34	.	assignment token	:
		 = is Python’s assignment token, which should not be confused with the mathematical comparison operator using the same symbol.	
35	.	class	:
		see data type below	
36	.	comment	:
		Information in a program that is meant for other programmers (or anyone reading the source code) and has no effect on the execution of the program.	
37	.	data type	:
		A set of values. The type of a value determines how it can be used in expressions. So far, the types you have seen are integers (int), floating-point numbers (float), and strings (str).	
38	.	decrement	:
		Decrease by 1.	
39	.	evaluate	:
		To simplify an expression by performing the operations in order to yield a single value.	
40	.	expression	:
		A combination of operators and operands (variables and values) that represents a single result value. Expressions are evaluated to give that result.	
41	.	float	:
		A Python data type which stores floating-point numbers. Floating-point numbers are stored internally in two parts: a base and an exponent. When printed in the standard format, they look like decimal numbers. Beware of rounding errors when you use floats, and remember that they are only approximate values.	
42	.	increment	:
		Both as a noun and as a verb, increment means to increase by 1.	
43	.	initialization (of a variable)	:
		To initialize a variable is to give it an initial value. Since in Python variables don’t exist until they are assigned values, they are initialized when they are created. In other programming languages this is not the case, and variables can be created without being initialized, in which case they have either default or garbage values.	
44	.	int	:
		A Python data type that holds positive and negative whole numbers.	
45	.	integer division	:
		An operation that divides one integer by another and yields an integer. Integer division yields only the whole number of times that the numerator is divisible by the denominator and discards any remainder.	
46	.	keyword	:
		A reserved word that is used by the compiler to parse program; you cannot use keywords like if, def, and while as variable names.	
47	.	modulus operator	:
		Also called remainder operator or integer remainder operator. Gives the remainder after performing integer division.	
48	.	object	:
		Also known as a data object (or data value). The fundamental things that programs are designed to manipulate (or that programmers ask to do things for them).	
49	.	operand	:
		One of the values on which an operator operates.	
50	.	operator	:
		A special symbol that represents a simple computation like addition, multiplication, or string concatenation.	
51	.	prompt string	:
		Used during interactive input to provide the user with hints as to what type of value to enter.	
52	.	reference diagram	:
		A picture showing a variable with an arrow pointing to the value (object) that the variable refers to. See also state snapshot.	
53	.	rules of precedence	:
		The set of rules governing the order in which expressions involving multiple operators and operands are evaluated.	
54	.	state snapshot	:
		A graphical representation of a set of variables and the values to which they refer, taken at a particular instant during the program’s execution.	
55	.	statement	:
		An instruction that the Python interpreter can execute. So far we have only seen the assignment statement, but we will soon meet the import statement and the for statement.	
56	.	str	:
		A Python data type that holds a string of characters.	
57	.	type conversion function	:
		A function that can convert a data value from one type to another.	
58	.	value	:
		A number or string (or other things to be named later) that can be stored in a variable or computed in an expression.	
59	.	variable	:
		A name that refers to a value.	
60	.	variable name	:
		A name given to a variable. Variable names in Python consist of a sequence of letters (a..z, A..Z, and _) and digits (0..9) that begins with a letter. In best programming practice, variable names should be chosen so that they describe their use in the program, making the program self documenting.	
61	.	attribute	:
		Some state or value that belongs to a particular object. For example, tess has a color.	
62	.	canvas	:
		A surface within a window where drawing takes place.	
63	.	control flow	:
		See flow of execution in the next chapter.	
64	.	deterministic	:
		A process that is repeatable and predictable.	
65	.	documentation	:
		A place where you can go to get detailed information about aspects of your programming language.	
66	.	for loop	:
		A statement in Python for convenient repetition of statements in the body of the loop.	
67	.	instance	:
		An object that belongs to a class. tess and alex are different instances of the class Turtle	
68	.	invoke	:
		An object has methods. We use the verb invoke to mean activate the method. Invoking a method is done by putting parentheses after the method name, with some possible arguments. So wn.exitonclick() is an invocation of the exitonclick method.	
69	.	iteration	:
		A basic building block for algorithms (programs). It allows steps to be repeated. Sometimes called looping.	
70	.	loop body	:
		Any number of statements nested inside a loop. The nesting is indicated by the fact that the statements are indented under the for loop statement.	
71	.	loop variable	:
		A variable used as part of a for loop. It is assigned a different value on each iteration of the loop, and is used as part of the terminating condition of the loop.	
72	.	method	:
		A function that is attached to an object. Invoking or activating the method causes the object to respond in some way, e.g. forward is the method when we say tess.forward(100).	
73	.	module	:
		A file containing Python definitions and statements intended for use in other Python programs. The contents of a module are made available to the other program by using the import statement.	
74	.	object	:
		A “thing” to which a variable can refer. This could be a screen window, or one of the turtles you have created.	
75	.	pseudo-random number	:
		A number that is not genuinely random but is instead created algorithmically.	
76	.	random number	:
		A number that is generated in such a way as to exhibit statistical randomness.	
77	.	random number generator	:
		A function that will provide you with random numbers, usually between 0 and 1.	
78	.	range	:
		A built-in function in Python for generating sequences of integers. It is especially useful when we need to write a for loop that executes a fixed number of times.	
79	.	sequential	:
		The default behavior of a program. Step by step processing of algorithm.	
80	.	standard library	:
		A collection of modules that are part of the normal installation of Python.	
81	.	state	:
		The collection of attribute values that a specific data object maintains.	
82	.	terminating condition	:
		A condition that occurs which causes a loop to stop repeating its body. In the for loops we saw in this chapter, the terminating condition has been when there are no more elements to assign to the loop variable.	
83	.	turtle	:
		A data object used to create pictures (known as turtle graphics).
